# Syllabus

* Spring 2019: WEB Programming Workshop | RISD GRAPH-3188
* 1 credit
* Section 1: Bobby Joe Smith III (bsmith07@risd.edu) | Room 211

How can we design not only for what the web is today, but for what the web could be? Designing for the internet requires an understanding of the unique interactive experience offered by the web medium. This introductory course will cover the technical basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as the latest practices in web design and development. We’ll learn the tools and techniques involved in creating a website from scratch, while exploring the application of graphic design principles to web-based technology. Class time will consist of discussions of relevant readings, technical lectures, design critiques, and hands-on coding workshops.

## Lectures
All lectures are posted on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nRwsSQuCm52kGZWwT1bPJpl-LhgEDLSs)

## Exercises and Projects
All assignments are posted on the [Home](https://github.com/risdesignet/wd-winter19/wiki) page on the Wiki. Exercises are in-class / take-home assignments for practicing or extending material covered in class. Projects are larger assignments to shape your own content. There will be 4 projects over the course of the semester.

## Readings
Readings will be assigned every week. We will discuss the readings in class, in relation to work out in the public and by your peers. Each student must submit a brief response to the appropriate Slack channel the night before the assigned reading is due. Your responses may also be replies to existing comments. Questions should be oriented for in-class discussion, directed to your fellow students. Be prepared to discuss the texts in class.

## Attendance
One unexcused absence and your letter grade drops by one, i.e. from A to a B. Two unexcused absences and you will be dropped from the course. Two late arrivals without prior arrangements equals one unexcused absence. Students who have been absent are expected to have their work completed the class session following their return. To obtain an excused absence, you must both write the instructor in advance and bring in medical documentation.

## Diversity
It is important to us that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives are well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs are addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity students bring to this class are viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. We strive to present materials and activities that challenge accepted canons and are respectful and representative of diversity: gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, culture, perspective, and other background characteristics. Your suggestions about how to improve the value of diversity in this course are always encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know how we might improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.
